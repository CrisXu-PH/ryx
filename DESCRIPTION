Description: This package deals with correlation among variables.
    ryx calculates correlations between one outcome variable and a group 
    of independent variables, respectively, as well as significance of the correlations.
    The final result is reported in the form of a correlation table.
    
    Three generic functions (i.e., print.ryx, summary.ryx, plot.ryx) are
    implemented. These functions can be used to report table of ryx class.
